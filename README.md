## Tech
Aline is written in Python3 and uses many third-party libraries to implement neural network's work. To run the code from the repository you need to have the following list of installed modules:
* `NumPy` - package for scientific computing with Python
* `SciKit-Learn` - free software machine learning library
* `Pandas` - library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools
* `XGBoost` - open-source software library which provides a gradient boosting framework

All this technologies provide us stable and good work with our project
